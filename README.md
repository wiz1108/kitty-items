üëã Welcome! This demo app was created to help you learn how to build on Flow.

- Kitty Items is a **complete NFT marketplace** built with [Cadence](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence), Flow's resource-oriented smart contract programming language.
- Learn how to deploy contracts, mint NFTs, and integrate user wallets with the Flow Client Library (FCL).

## üé¨ Live Demo

Check out the [live demo of Kitty Items](https://dark-frost-1788.on.fleek.co/),
deployed on [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/case-study-fleek/) and the Flow Testnet.

## ‚ú® Getting Started

### 1. Install the Flow CLI

Before you start, install the [Flow command-line interface (CLI)](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli).

### 2. Clone the project

```sh
git clone git@github.com:onflow/kitty-items.git
```

### 3. Configure projects

Follow the setup instructions in the `README.md` files inside each folder to set up each project's environment variables.  

### 4. Start the Flow Emulator

Start the Flow emulator by running the following command in the project's root directory: 
```
flow project start-emulator 
```

### 5. Deploy contracts
With the emulator running you can deploy the Kitty Items contracts. Run the following command form the project's root directory:
```
flow project deploy-contracts 
```

### 5. Start the API

After the contracts are deployed, follow the [kitty-items-js instructions](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/tree/master/kitty-items-js)
to install and run the Kitty Items API. This backend service is responsible for initializing accounts, minting NFTs, and processing events.

### 6. Start the dev-wallet

When developing locally, you'll need an emulated wallet as well. The wallet let's you create accounts and sign transactions as user's other than the emulator's service account.

Run this command to start the dev-wallet from the `fcl-dev-wallet` directory: 
```
npm install && npm run start:dev
```

### 7. Launch the web app

Lastly, follow the [kitty-items-web instructions](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/tree/master/kitty-items-web) to launch the Kitty Items front-end React app.

## üîé Legend

Above is a basic diagram of the parts of this project contained in each folder, and how each part interacts with the others.

### 1. The Flow Emulator

Flow is a next-generation blockchain platform that is designed to be fast and easy to use. If you're new to Flow, consider reading more about it in the [Flow Primer](https://www.onflow.org/primer), or visit the [developer documentation](https://docs.onflow.org/). The emulator simulates Flow's operatio in a singel process you can run locally while developing. Read about the emulator [here](https://docs.onflow.org/emulator)

### 2. Web App (Static website) | [kitty-items-web](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/tree/master/kitty-items-web)

A true dapp, client-only web app. This is a complete web application built with React that demonstrates how to build a static website that can be deployed to an environment like IPFS and connects directly to the Flow blockchain using `@onflow/fcl`. No servers required. `@onflow/fcl` handles authentication and authorization of [Flow accounts](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/accounts-and-keys/), [signing transactions](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/transaction-signing/), and querying data using using Cadence scripts.

### 3. Look Ma, a Web Server! | [kitty-items-js](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/tree/master/kitty-items-js)

We love decentralization, but servers are still very useful, and this one's no exception. The code in this project demonstrates how to connect to Flow using [Flow JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk) from a NodeJS backend. It's also chalk-full of handy patterns you'll proabably want to use for more complex and feature-rich blockchain applications, like storing and querying events using a SQL database (Postgres). The API demonstrates how to send transactions to the Flow Blockchain, specifically for minting [Kibbles](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/blob/master/kitty-items-cadence/contracts/Kibble.cdc) (fungible tokens) and [Kitty Items](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/blob/master/kitty-items-cadence/contracts/KittyItems.cdc) (non-fungible tokens).

### 4. Cadence Code | [kitty-items-cadence](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/tree/master/kitty-items-cadence)

[Cadence](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence) smart contracts, scripts & transactions for your viewing pleasure. This folder contains all of the blockchain logic for the marketplace application. Here you will find examples of [fungible token](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft) and [non-fungible token (NFT)](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft) smart contract implementations, as well as the scripts and transactions that interact with them. It also contains examples of how to *test* your Cadence code (tests written in Golang).

### 5. Dev Wallet

The dev-wallet simulates a Flow compatible wallet so you can test multi-user interactions. It also comes with some handy tools to help you work with accounts using `@onflow/fcl` (Flow's official JavaScript SDK). Read more about the wallet and `@onflow/fcl` [here](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-js-sdk)


## üò∫ What are Kitty Items?

Items are hats for your cats, but under the hood they're [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft) stored on the Flow blockchain.

Items can be purchased from the marketplace with fungible tokens.
In the future you'll be able to add them to [Ethereum CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) with ownership validated by an oracle.
