üëã Welcome! This demo app was created to help you learn how to build on Flow.

- Kitty Items is a **complete NFT marketplace** built with [Cadence](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence), Flow's resource-oriented smart contract programming language.
- Learn how to deploy contracts, mint NFTs, and integrate user wallets with the Flow Client Library (FCL).

## üé¨ Live Demo

Check out the [live demo of Kitty Items](https://dark-frost-1788.on.fleek.co/),
deployed on [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/case-study-fleek/) and the Flow Testnet.

## ‚ú® Getting Started

### 1. Install the Flow CLI

Before you start, install the [Flow command-line interface (CLI)](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli).

### 2. Clone the project

```sh
git clone git@github.com:onflow/kitty-items.git
```

### 3. Create a Flow Testnet account

You'll need a Testnet account to work on this project. Here's how to make one:

- Generate a new key pair with the Flow CLI: `flow keys generate` (_‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to save these keys in a safe place, you'll need them later._)
- Go to the [Flow Testnet Faucet](https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org/) to create a new account. Use the **public key** from the previous step.
- After a short time, you'll receive an email with your newly-created Flow **account address**.

```sh
export TESTNET_ADDRESS={YOUR_TESTNET_ADDRESS}
export TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY={YOUR_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY}
```

### 4. Deploy the contracts

```sh
flow project deploy --network=testnet
```

### 5. Run the API

After the contracts are deployed, follow the [Kitty Items API instructions](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/tree/master/api)
to install and run the Kitty Items API. This backend service is responsible for initializing accounts, minting NFTs, and processing events.

### 6. Launch the web app

Lastly, follow the [Kitty Items Web instructions](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/tree/master/web) to launch the Kitty Items front-end React app.

## üîé Legend

Above is a basic diagram of the parts of this project contained in each folder, and how each part interacts with the others.

### 1. Web App (Static website) | [kitty-items/web](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/tree/master/web)

A true dapp, client-only web app. This is a complete web application built with React that demonstrates how to build a static website that can be deployed to an environment like IPFS and connects directly to the Flow blockchain using `@onflow/fcl`. No servers required. `@onflow/fcl` handles authentication and authorization of [Flow accounts](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/accounts-and-keys/), [signing transactions](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/transaction-signing/), and querying data using using Cadence scripts.

### 2. Look Ma, a Web Server! | [kitty-items/api](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/tree/master/api)

We love decentralization, but servers are still very useful, and this one's no exception. The code in this project demonstrates how to connect to Flow using [Flow JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk) from a Node JS backend. It's also chalk-full of handy patterns you'll probably want to use for more complex and feature-rich blockchain applications, like storing and querying events using a SQL database (Postgres). The API demonstrates how to send transactions to the Flow Blockchain, specifically for minting [Kibbles](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/blob/master/cadence/contracts/Kibble.cdc) (fungible tokens) and [Kitty Items](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/blob/master/cadence/contracts/KittyItems.cdc) (non-fungible tokens).

### 3. Cadence Code | [kitty-items/cadence](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/tree/master/cadence)

[Cadence](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence) smart contracts, scripts & transactions for your viewing pleasure. This folder contains all of the blockchain logic for the marketplace application. Here you will find examples of [fungible token](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft) and [non-fungible token (NFT)](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft) smart contract implementations, as well as the scripts and transactions that interact with them. It also contains examples of how to _test_ your Cadence code (tests written in Golang).

## üò∫ What are Kitty Items?

Items are hats for your cats, but under the hood they're [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft) stored on the Flow blockchain.

Items can be purchased from the marketplace with fungible tokens.
In the future you'll be able to add them to [Ethereum CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) with ownership validated by an oracle.

üöÄ Happy Hacking!
